                            Sriharikota, Tirupati district of Andhra Pradesh, is the primary spaceport of the Indian
                            Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</p>
                        <p>Sriharikota island was chosen in 1969 for a satellite launching station. The centre became
                            operational in 1971 when an RH-125 sounding rocket was launched.</p>
                        <p>The first attempted launch of an orbital satellite, Rohini 1A aboard a Satellite Launch
                            Vehicle, took place on 10 August 1979, but due to a failure in thrust vectoring of the
                            rocket's second stage, the satellite's orbit decayed on 19 August 1979.</p>
                        <p>SHAR was named as 'Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR' (SDSC), on 5 September 2002, in memory of
                            Satish Dhawan, former chairman of the ISRO.</p>
                        <p>The SHAR facility now consists of two launch pads, with the second built in 2005. The second
                            launch pad was used for launches beginning in 2005 and is a universal launch pad,
                            accommodating all of the launch vehicles used by ISRO.</p>
                        <p>The two launch pads will allow multiple launches in a single year, which was not possible
                            earlier. India's lunar orbiter Chandrayaan-1 launched from the centre at 6:22 AM IST on 22
                            October 2008. India's first Mars orbiter Mangalyaan was launched from the centre on 5
                            November 2013, which was successfully placed into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.</p>
